## 📌 Insights & Recommendations  

1. **Profitability Issue**: Bookcases and tables are loss-making categories. Reassess pricing, discounts, or supplier terms.  
2. **Regional Opportunity**: Some states (e.g., Kansas) contribute negligible sales. Targeted promotions may improve regional performance.  
3. **Seasonal Demand**: September peaks indicate opportunities for back-to-school / office setup campaigns.  
4. **Segment Diversification**: Current focus is on Consumers. Expanding Corporate and Home Office segments could unlock additional growth.
